Visualize.js
============

Visualize.js is a JavaScript API framework used to embed JasperReport Server reports & visualizations inside web applications.
It comes bundled with the commercial editions of TIBCO JasperReports® Server, specifically Jaspersoft AWS, Enterprise or
Professional (and as an add-on with Jaspersoft Reporting).

> In this guide you will find a full listing of Visualize.js API code samples.

Report Samples
=======

### Basic Embed

Try it:

<b>[Simple report rendering], [from a list]</b>

Initialization of the visualize.js library with simple rendering of an HTML report using plain text authentication. See full authentication samples in this guide for securing data and reports with the JasperReports Server and Visualize.js.

>You can easily change the resource to embed a different report from the JasperReport Server.

>For example:

``` javascript
        resource: "/public/Samples/Reports/SalesByMonthReport"
``` 

Try it:

<b>[Load multiple reports]</b>

Use a common configuration to load multiple reports.

### Pagination

Try it:

<b>[Next/previous]</b>, <b>[enter range]</b>, <b>[pagination events]</b>

Provide control for report pagination with either individual selectors or a directly inputed range. Also, see pagination with events for full control of inputs.

Try it:

<b>[Anchors]</b>, <b>[range with anchor]</b>, <b>[anchor and page search]</b>

Provide the ability to move quickly through reports with direct page anchors. Also see an anchor with a range of rendered pages and an example of searching both an anchor and page/range with an event to callout the current selection.

### Custom Input Controls

Try it:

<b>[Paramater passing]</b>, <b>[basic drop-down]</b>, <b>[render values]</b>

Pass a simple set of hard-coded parameters to control report output. This can be expanded with custom inputs controls such as a drop-down. In addition, input control values can be rendered directly from the JasperReport Server.

>Try: A hard coded or dynamic variable...

``` javascript
      inputSelection = "Non-Consumable"
``` 

>for parameter control...

``` javascript
      "ProductFamily": ["Food", inputSelection]
```

Try it:

<b>[Dynamic resource types]</b>

<b>[Parameter passing on selection]</b>, <b>[parameter in a new page]</b>

Select from a chart series to pass a paramater into a secondary report. In addition pass this same paramater into a new page/tab.

### Events

Try it:

<b>[Page totals]</b>, <b>[report status]</b>

Listen through events for a change in the page totals and report completed status.

### UI Controls
